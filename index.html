    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure 
        his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your 
        answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Here are some key points how I would advise a 
        potential client to secure their website from security attacks. First of all, 
        you need a secure URL, getting an SSL and an HTTPS certificate will benefit 
        you greatly. This is an essential way of making sure your website is secure 
        and your users information is protected. The second advice would be to 
        include everybody in your business in the security practices, everybody with 
        access to valuable data should have basic training in web security. You 
        should also be careful who has access to what, it is vital to train your 
        employees before giving them website access. 

        Some other easier improvements would be to make sure that your passwords are 
        strong. In some cases the only thing standing in the way of a hacker getting 
        valuable information is your password. If you are using “password123”, you 
        should probably change it. Another thing is keeping your website's software 
        up to date. 
        
        If things fail and there is a security breach It is wise to keep a backup 
        of your website, this way you can recover data from any point from before 
        the virus or hack occurred. 
        
        To create websites has never been easier, but you cannot just set up a page 
        and forget it. Maintaining the security of the site is absolutely necessary.
